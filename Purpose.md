The Wardley Mapping Foundation exists for the public benefit, to promote, sustain and increase knowledge on the mapping of competitive landscapes for individuals and collectives around the world.

To achieve this, it will:
1. Create, maintain, share and support open repositories of knowledge that are free to use
2. Encourage and facilitate research to advance public knowledge
3. Facilitate the creation of open training materials and public education programmes
4. Facilitate the hosting of events focused on educating the public and sharing knowledge
5. Encourage and facilitate the creation of open standards and tooling that improve the state of mapping
6. Support the growth of an international community of people and organisations that share our values
