# The Wardley Mapping Foundation's Purpose
The foundation exists to promote, sustain and increase knowledge of the mapping of competitive landscapes for individuals and collectives around the world, for the public benefit.

To achieve this, its focus is to:
1. Create, maintain, share and support open repositories of knowledge that are free to use
2. Encourage and facilitate research to advance public knowledge
3. Facilitate the creation of open training materials and public education programmes
4. Facilitate the hosting of events focused on educating the public and sharing knowledge
5. Encourage and facilitate the creation of open standards and tooling that improve the state of mapping
6. Support the growth of an international community of people and organisations that share our values

# Operating Principles
We use Simon's 40 guides to help us make better decisions.

# Values
Shalom Schwartz' [Theory of Basic Values](https://doi.org/10.9707/2307-0919.1116), and Oliver Scott Curry's [7 Universal Moral Rules](https://doi.org/10.1086/701478) both suggest that people share a universal set of human values regardless of race, ethniticy, gender, etc.

We subscribe to Curry's premise that **cooperative interactions are non-zero-sum games**.  We believe that by understanding competitive landscapes, individuals & collectives can influence the mode of competition itself.

We are:
1. **Open** - we promote open bodies of knowledge, standards, tools & services that, wherever possible, are free to use.  Years ago, Simon Wardley decided to gift his mapping research to the public, we seek to maintain that tradition.
1. **Inclusive** - we believe that diversity of perspectives & thought builds more resilient ideas & organisations.  As we serve people the world over, it makes sense that anyone is welcome to join, contribute or attend events.
