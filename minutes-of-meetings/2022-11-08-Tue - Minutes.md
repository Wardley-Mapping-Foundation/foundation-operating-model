## Follow-ups and direction

- Discord service contract should be marked 'draft'.

- For the potential trustees:
  - Create table of options, their Pros and Cons, how they constrain us.
  - Look at examples of companies that fit these groups.

- Look at funding options, such as, applying for grants.

## Discussions

Went over feedback we got about the different structures of legal entities. Direction is going for a Compay limited by Guarantee.

- We've ruled out making the foundation a charity because the requirement of not having conflict of interest (if anyone works or makes a living from Wardley Mapping, they cannot participate in the charity) excludes many, if not all, Wardley Mappers.

- Walked through the frame "Governance" on the Miro board, https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOcvEfQM=/?moveToWidget=3458764537067591333&cot=14

- Another reason for not choosing a Charity structure is to be more independent of donors. Some donations could come with strings attached.
