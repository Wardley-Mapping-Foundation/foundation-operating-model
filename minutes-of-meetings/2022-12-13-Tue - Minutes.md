## Discussions

Needs thank you note writing for those who contributed, still at same point as last week.

Agreed to close, with minutes more useful than a full transcript. Noted that transcription useful as a minuting tool, not published directly.

Agreed to close, summary on ticket sufficient. We note that if we received donations outside the UK, we'd likely have to deal with the bureaucracy of this ourselves.

- How will we know when the doc is at a satisfactory level, and who decides? Need to finish items raised via comments on the document.
- Catherine will look at doc after call.
- Arrange collaborative editing after 3pm on Friday, in General Discord channel, @spurkis to do calendar invite.

- @agvbergin has copied model articles for a company limited by guarantee into a new google doc and started making comments.
- We can also look at this together on Friday.
- Already written purposes may map to objects.
- Important to approach trustees in a structured and intentional way, so we discussed and agreed to tidy-up the docs satisfactorily, then go to potential trustees, and then have them vetted by a lawyer.
- Approach to trustees needs to be focused and maintain diversity beyond the tech industry.
